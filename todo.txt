GO MAKE THE SYSTEM TO READ AND WRITE ENERGY FOCUS AND MOOD IN data.mood WHEN PULLED FROM THE SERVER WHENEVER THE USER INPUTS HOW THEY FEEL
THEN DO THE FANCY AI SHIT OR WHATEVER TO FIGURE OUT OVERALL MOOD AND STUFF
 - added the hour bar things
  - need to make them inside the timeline div and stretch to fit the full space
 - then figure out priority formula and run it on 5 minute interval of times and load the highest priority task
  - there is disparity between the button for prioritiest and sort by urgency formulas, suspecting it has something to do with the math for overdue things






add description to what to put in the add task fields with one of those cool question mark in circle thingies
figure out calculation system for priority
task sorting by date added, most/least points, and filter (i.e. hours < 2)
timeline system

POTENTIAL FUTURE THINGS
mobile support
task inheritance, like you could make an acct for the group and you can set your own acct to sync with the group acct and read what is going on for the group
- group view could see (user has X tasks) just how many tasks they have
- and it can be parent of parent so like company can see accounting has 12 tasks, accounting can see jim has 3 tasks
a library to make it so that you can read and add tasks from code instead of having to use the webpage
ai to predict/autofill things based on your habits
if trying to access userpage without login redirect to login
task splitting (i.e. make electrical component turns into get mats, strip, splice, solder etc)
- shows percent bar of subtasks complete to complete task
