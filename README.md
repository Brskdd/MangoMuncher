## Project Overview: Wellbeing Score and Task Management
This project aims to help users maintain a high wellbeing score by accomplishing tasks and fostering happiness while minimizing trouble and consequences. The wellbeing score represents an overall measure of personal wellbeing, which can increase through achievements and happiness and decrease through difficulties and consequences.

### Objectives and Task Types
Users can add objectives to their wellbeing score, which can be of two types: scheduled and unscheduled tasks.

- Scheduled Tasks: These tasks have deadlines, set rewards/consequences, and specific due dates. For example, school assignments fall into this category. Users can define points, difficulty, and estimated time required for each task, which can be broken down into fragments.

- Unscheduled Tasks: These tasks don't have specific due dates but are still important for the overall wellbeing score. Similar to scheduled tasks, unscheduled tasks have points, difficulty levels, and estimated time requirements. However, the urgency and consequences are determined based on the last time the task was completed.

### Task Management and Roadmap Generation
The project analyzes various data points, including task information, energy levels, and personal preferences, to generate a roadmap of recommended tasks. Users can set goals and biases to guide the task generation process.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the functionality:

- Productivity Focus: After returning home from school with low energy, the system suggests 30 minutes of downtime for recharging, followed by 2 hours of work on a history project due next week. As the effort is put into the history project, the urgency of a math assignment due tomorrow increases. Recognizing the low energy level, the system recommends taking a 1-hour break before studying French for general upkeep. Considering the current stats and low energy, the system suggests having free time for the rest of the night, acknowledging that pushing beyond this point may lead to fatigue and unhappiness.

- Happiness Focus: During the summer, a user has a list of unscheduled chores to complete. Starting the day with high energy and a productive mood, the system recommends spending the first few hours on hobbies. As energy levels decrease around lunchtime, the system suggests doing low-energy tasks like washing the dishes. Afterward, the user engages in leisure activities. Towards the evening, the user can return to hobbies and, when energy allows, proceed to mow the lawn. Recharging with friends online is then encouraged until tiredness sets in, followed by sleep.
